Goal & Hypotheses — Expected enqueue/dequeue complexity for PriorityQueue and 
reasoning about tie stability cost. 


• Methodology — Data sizes (N), seeds, distributions, machine info, JVM flags (if any). 


• Results — Tables of times; simple charts (paste from spreadsheet). 


• Analysis — Compare observed growth to O(log n); discuss constants and GC effects. 


• Limits & Threats to Validity — Takeaways & Future Work (re-triage approach, multiple queues 
per severity band, etc.).
